**Overview**


This project is a fun and engaging game inspired by the classic "Flappy Bird" concept. However, we’ve completely reimagined the game’s theme, transitioning from the traditional pixelated design to an exciting Avengers-themed adventure. The game now features popular characters, a dynamic environment, and a fresh, modern appeal that makes it even more enjoyable.


**Theme**


We have transformed the game's theme to the Avengers Universe, incorporating beloved characters such as Iron Man, Thor, and various enemies from the series. The game's visuals and design have been enhanced to reflect this new theme, making it more visually striking and appealing to fans of both the game and the Avengers franchise.


**Game Features**


**Hero Character:**  Control iconic heroes from the Avengers, each with unique abilities and animations.

**Enemies:**  Battle against enemies from the Avengers universe, each bringing new challenges to the game.

**Background:**  A custom-designed background featuring settings inspired by the Avengers' world.

**Sound Effects:**  Immersive sound effects to accompany your gameplay and enhance the experience.


**How to Play**


The gameplay is simple, yet challenging. The objective is to navigate your character through the screen, avoiding obstacles and enemies. Here’s how to play:

**Jumping:**  Press the Spacebar to make your character jump.

**Falling:**  Release the Spacebar to make your character fall.

**Avoid Obstacles:**  Move through the levels while avoiding incoming obstacles and enemies.

**Scoring:**  Collect points as you successfully navigate through the enemies and obstacles.

The interface is designed to be user-friendly, with intuitive controls that allow players of all ages to easily pick up and enjoy the game.
